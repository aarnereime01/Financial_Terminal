A hobby project aimed at automating the retrieval of financial data for a stock. The project's ultimate objective is to gather data from specified ticker symbols, process the received values, and provide insights to assist in making informed stock investment decisions.

# TODO:

- Bypass bot detection (after a few requests, it takes me to a look up page instead of the stock page)
- Look into the possibility of using finviz for data retrieval
- Add more metrics (GuruFocus, etc.)
- Divide stocks into sectors, so that we can compare stocks within the same sector (comparing all stocks is not very useful)
